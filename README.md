Log in to osTicket's dashboard and navigate to the 'Tickets' tab. Here you will be able to select the open ticket(s) you wish to intake and work through. In this example, the open ticket involves the user reporting that the program, Adobe Reader, is not working properly.
</p>

</p>
<p>
From here, we can inspect the ticket further to gain more information as to what may be causing the issue. Check to see if the end user posted some more information under the ticket thread. If you only have limited information that was provided, the best way to proceed would be to contact the end user who submitted the ticket so that we may clarify more information and to better understand the criticality of the ticket. This will help establish a proper service level agreement on this ticket.

</p>
<p>
Once you have gathered all the information from the end user to clearly assess the situation, it is best to notate a clear and concise response to show the next steps of what may be needed to be worked on to resolve the issue.
</p>
<br />

<p>
Be sure to change the priority to coincide with the service level agreement.

</p>
<p>
Once a solution has been established, make sure to notate the information under the service ticket thread to ensure communication has been made, and clearly describe what processes were taken to reach that resolution.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Once you have confirmed that the end user(s) are up and running with a proper solution to the issue they reported, change the open ticket status to 'Closed' along with any closing statement to the thread to help communicate the resolution if needed. This will now properly close out the ticket and complete the task to its completion.
